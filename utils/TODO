1. Combine functionality of making diffs -> extracting features
2. Clarify that `parse_directives.pl` is meant as a stand-in for extracting features from non-cmake-based projects
3. Combine make_diffs* and take cmd line arg for mosquitto vs other protocols
4. Fix the error(s) of unmatched braces on code removal
5. Integrate KLEE test generation into a script like `make_diffs.sh`
6. Individually-debloated Mosquitto versions for following features:
	- Wrap (done), Websocket (done), persistence (done), TLS (done), PSK, Systree (done), and Bridge (done)
	- Also one version with all of the above features removed

7. Make command-line flag for switching between compiling `mosquitto` with `clang` vs `gcc`
	- We currently invoke `gcc` for dumping the CFG `dot` files
